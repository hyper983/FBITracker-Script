🛰️ Advanced FBI Tracking SystemElevating Intelligence Operations in Los SantosThe Advanced FBI Tracking System is a premium, high-fidelity digital interface designed for elite FiveM roleplay communities. It serves as a centralized intelligence hub, bridging the gap between field operations and satellite-based surveillance.💎 Design Philosophy: The Neon-Glass AestheticThe interface is built on the principles of Glassmorphism, creating a seamless integration with the game environment.Translucency: Uses high-end backdrop filters to create a "glass" look that feels part of the high-tech FBI arsenal.Cyber-Neon Accents: Inspired by futuristic espionage systems, utilizing #00f2ff (Cyan Neon) to ensure clarity and a "Special Ops" atmosphere.Micro-Animations: Every interaction, from hover states to list loading, features smooth cubic-bezier transitions for a professional feel.🌟 Key Capabilities🛰️ Live Satellite UplinkThe system provides a real-time bridge to the server's player database, displaying active targets within a sophisticated grid layout. Each player card is a data point, showing essential ID and coordinate information.📍 Precision GPS PinpointingWith a single interaction, the system calculates a target's trajectory and locks their current coordinates directly into the operative's GPS system. This allows for seamless transitions from surveillance to active pursuit.📱 Responsive IntelligenceBuilt with modern web technologies, the UI is fully responsive. Whether the operative is using a wide-screen monitor or a standard display, the intelligence feed adapts without losing visual fidelity or functional layout.⚡ Performance-First ArchitectureDespite its complex visual appearance, the system is engineered for maximum efficiency.Zero-Latency UI: Optimized NUI callbacks ensure the interface remains snappy and responsive.Low Footprint: Designed to run with near-zero resource impact, ensuring the game's frame rate remains stable during high-stakes operations.🔍 Use CasesFederal Investigations: Tracking high-priority suspects across the state.Search & Rescue: Locating missing persons or officers in distress.Strategic Coordination: Managing large-scale tactical deployments with real-time positioning.👨‍💻 Visionary DevelopmentThis project was conceptualized to push the boundaries of NUI (Native User Interface) design in FiveM, providing a tool that is as beautiful as it is functional for the Iranian and global roleplay community."In modern warfare, information is the most lethal weapon. The FBI Tracking System ensures you are always one step ahead."
