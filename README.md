🛰️ Advanced FBI Tracking System

Elevating Intelligence Operations in Los Santos

The Advanced FBI Tracking System is a premium, high-fidelity digital interface designed for elite FiveM roleplay communities. It serves as a centralized intelligence hub, bridging the gap between field operations and satellite-based surveillance.

💎 Design Philosophy: The Neon-Glass Aesthetic

The interface is built on the principles of Glassmorphism, creating a seamless integration with the game environment.

Translucency: Uses high-end backdrop filters to create a "glass" look that feels part of the high-tech FBI arsenal.

Cyber-Neon Accents: Inspired by futuristic espionage systems, utilizing #00f2ff (Cyan Neon) to ensure clarity and a "Special Ops" atmosphere.

Micro-Animations: Every interaction, from hover states to list loading, features smooth cubic-bezier transitions for a professional feel.

🌟 Key Capabilities

🛰️ Live Satellite Uplink

The system provides a real-time bridge to the server's player database, displaying active targets within a sophisticated grid layout. Each player card is a data point, showing essential ID and coordinate information.

📍 Precision GPS Pinpointing

With a single interaction, the system calculates a target's trajectory and locks their current coordinates directly into the operative's GPS system. This allows for seamless transitions from surveillance to active pursuit.

📱 Responsive Intelligence

Built with modern web technologies, the UI is fully responsive. Whether the operative is using a wide-screen monitor or a standard display, the intelligence feed adapts without losing visual fidelity or functional layout.

⚡ Performance-First Architecture

Despite its complex visual appearance, the system is engineered for maximum efficiency.

Zero-Latency UI: Optimized NUI callbacks ensure the interface remains snappy and responsive.

Low Footprint: Designed to run with near-zero resource impact, ensuring the game's frame rate remains stable during high-stakes operations.

🔍 Use Cases

Federal Investigations: Tracking high-priority suspects across the state.

Search & Rescue: Locating missing persons or officers in distress.

Strategic Coordination: Managing large-scale tactical deployments with real-time positioning.

👨‍💻 Visionary Development

This project was conceptualized to push the boundaries of NUI (Native User Interface) design in FiveM, providing a tool that is as beautiful as it is functional for the Iranian and global roleplay community.
